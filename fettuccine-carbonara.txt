Ingredients:
 - 375g fresh fettuccine
 - 100g pancetta, coarsely chopped
 - 2 eggs, lightly whisked
 - 2 egg yolks
 - 1/2 cup (40g) finely grated parmesan
 - 1/2 cup (125ml) thickened cream
 - Shaved parmesan, extra, to serve
 - Mixed salad leaves, to serve

Directions:
 1. Cook the pasta in a large saucepan of salted boiling water until al dente. Drain well.

 2. Meanwhile, heat a medium frying pan over high heat. Add the pancetta and cook, 
    stirring occasionally, for 2-3 minutes or until just crisp. Remove from heat.

 3. Whisk the eggs, egg yolks, parmesan and cream in a medium bowl until well combined. 
    Season with salt and pepper.

 4. Return the hot pasta to the pan. Add the pancetta and pour over the egg mixture. 
    Gently toss until just combined (the heat of the pasta should cook the eggs; do 
    not overcook).

 5. Divide evenly among serving bowls. Top with shaved parmesan and serve  
    immediately with mixed salad leaves, if desired.
